## About Me

Hi I'm Andrew. A fun fact about myself is that I can speak Cantonese and Mandarin fluently because I spent almost 5 years in Beijing, China from 2013-2018.

### How I put this portfolio together

Since a starter template was given for this assignment, the main goal was to make the content responsible at 980px, 768px, and 640px. The main adjustments were made in the style.css file, which included:

* Media query tags (which included making the header static at 640px, a requirement)
* Adding viewport tags to the HTML

Initially, I struggled with getting the layout of my page to sit according to the example, but with the guidance of Jacob and one of the code drills, I learned to insert "display: block" in order to make "float: none and margin:auto" function properly. Later on, I also had a hard time getting the image in index.html to respond accordingly with the text sitting next to it, but after playing around a bit with the Google Dev Inspect Tool, I was able to work around it and get it to look somewhat like the examples given for this assignment.

### What I did not complete

* I didn't make much adjustments at 980px and 768px because it seemed that the page was looking to be about right, and 640px took a good amount of time to complete as well, because I initially tried out a bunch of things that didn't really work well together, and for better or worse, my computer crashed Monday, which forced me to start from scratch and simply/clean up the CSS file.

*Another thing that is still a problem at submission, is that the cat gets bigger than its supposed to be when reduced to 640px, which I couldn't figure out as well.

Overall, both assignments were really challenging, and I definitely wouldn't say that one is easier than the other; Bootstrap is easier to create a page overall, while the use of style.css in the non-Bootstrap made it easier to mess around with the dev tools/inspect and make changes there. It'll still take some more practice for me to get comfortable with media queries, but hopefully along with the feedback from this assignment, I'll be able to clean up the mistakes that were commited in this assignment.
