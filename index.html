      <p>Hi guys. My name is Andrew Xie, and I am a newb currently pursuing knowledge in web/software development at the
        UC Berkeley Coding
        Bootcamp. I graduated in July 2018 with a bachelor's degree in International Political Economy from Peking
        University, which is located in Beijing, China. For more information regarding why I did my bachelors in China
        and/or how that experience was, please feel free to contact me by email or through LinkedIn!
      </p>

      <p>Please feel free to come back to my page in mid-May, when I finish the Boot Camp, although I
        anticipate a fairly long road ahead before meeting the minimum requirements to be a successful developer. For the
        mean time, I would appreciate if you could take time to check out my Portfolio page, which includes 3
        individual assignments I have completed, along with a group project. The current skills I have picked up from
        this bootcamp, albeit limited, include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Firebase.</p>
